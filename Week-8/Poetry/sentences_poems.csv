331,19,it had the tassels on—
332,19,""
333,19,"i thought how yellow it would look—"

335,19,"and then, i wanted to get out,"
336,19,"but something held my will,"
337,19,""

340,19,"and the carts stooping round the fields"
341,19,to take the pumpkins in—
342,19,""

346,19,to make an even sum—
347,19,""
348,19,"and would it blur the christmas glee"

351,19,the altitude of me—
352,19,""
353,19,"but this sort, grieved myself,"

356,19,"themself, should come to me—"
357,20,414
358,20,""
359,20,"'twas like a maelstrom, with a notch,"
360,20,"that nearer, every day,"
361,20,"kept narrowing its boiling wheel"
362,20,until the agony
363,20,""
364,20,"toyed coolly with the final inch"
365,20,"of your delirious hem—"
366,20,"and you dropt, lost,"
367,20,"when something broke—"
368,20,and let you from a dream—
369,20,""
370,20,"as if a goblin with a gauge—"
371,20,"kept measuring the hours—"
372,20,"until you felt your second"
373,20,"weigh, helpless, in his paws—"
374,20,""
375,20,"and not a sinew—stirred—could help,"
376,20,"and sense was setting numb—"
377,20,"when god—remembered—and the fiend"
378,20,"let go, then, overcome—"
379,20,""
380,20,"as if your sentence stood—pronounced—"
381,20,"and you were frozen led"
382,20,"from dungeon's luxury of doubt"
383,20,"to gibbets, and the dead—"
384,20,""
385,20,"and when the film had stitched your eyes"
386,20,"a creature gasped ""reprieve""!"
387,20,"which anguish was the utterest—then—"
388,20,"to perish, or to live?"
389,21,394
390,21,""
391,21,"'twas love—not me—"
392,21,"oh punish—pray—"
393,21,"the real one died for thee—"
394,21,just him—not me—
395,21,""
396,21,"such guilt—to love thee—most!"
397,21,"doom it beyond the rest—"

406,22,""
407,22,"'twas the old—road—through pain—"

410,22,that stops—at heaven—
411,22,""
412,22,"this—was the town—she passed—"
413,22,"there—where she—rested—last—"
414,22,"then—stepped more fast—"
415,22,"the little tracks—close prest—"
416,22,"then—not so swift—"
417,22,"slow—slow—as feet did weary—grow—"
418,22,then—stopped—no other track!
419,22,""
420,22,"wait! look! her little book—"
421,22,"the leaf—at love—turned back—"
422,22,"her very hat—"
423,22,"and this worn shoe just fits the track—"
424,22,herself—though—fled!

426,22,"another bed—a short one—"

428,22,"in chambers bright—"
429,22,"too out of sight—though—"

431,22,to touch her head!
432,23,519
433,23,""
434,23,"'twas warm—at first—like us—"
435,23,"until there crept upon"
436,23,"a chill—like frost upon a glass—"
437,23,"till all the scene—be gone,"
438,23,""
439,23,"the forehead copied stone—"
440,23,"the fingers grew too cold"
441,23,"to ache—and like a skater's brook—"
442,23,the busy eyes—congealed—
443,23,""
444,23,"it straightened—that was all—"
445,23,"it crowded cold to cold—"
446,23,"it multiplied indifference—"
447,23,as pride were all it could—
448,23,""
449,23,"and even when with cords—"
450,23,"'twas lowered, like a weight—"
451,23,"it made no signal, nor demurred,"
452,23,"but dropped like adamant,"

472,25,"a bird came down the walk,"
473,25,"he did not know i saw;"
474,25,"he bit an angle-worm in halves"
475,25,"and ate the fellow, raw,"
476,25,""
477,25,"and then he drank a dew"
478,25,"from a convenient grass,"

486,25,""
487,25,"like one in danger; cautious,"
488,25,"i offered him a crumb,"
489,25,"and he unrolled his feathers"
490,25,and rowed him softer home

1243,72,"so looking on—the night—the morn"
1244,72,"conclude the wonder gay—"

1246,72,another summer's day!

1248,73,""
1249,73,"a south wind—has a pathos"

1252,73,"an emigrant's address,"
1253,73,""

1262,74,"when it was dark enough to do"
1263,74,without erasing sight—
1264,74,""
1265,74,"a quiet—earthquake style—"

1269,74,""
1270,74,"the solemn—torrid—symbol—"
1271,74,"the lips that never lie—"

1273,74,and cities—ooze away—
1274,75,"a thought went up my mind to-day"
1275,75,"that i have had before,"

4439,280,"my villages be seen—"
4440,280,"and possibly a steeple—"
4441,280,not afterward—by men—
4442,281,136
4443,281,""
4444,281,"have you got a brook in your little heart,"
4445,281,"where bashful flowers blow,"
4446,281,"and blushing birds go down to drink,"
4447,281,and shadows tremble so—
4448,281,""
4449,281,"and nobody knows, so still it flows,"
4450,281,"that any brook is there,"
4451,281,"and yet your little draught of life"
4452,281,is daily drunken there—
4453,281,""
4454,281,"why, look out for the little brook in march,"
4455,281,"when the rivers overflow,"
4456,281,"and the snows come hurrying from the fills,"
4457,281,and the bridges often go—
4458,281,""
4459,281,"and later, in august it may be—"
4460,281,"when the meadows parching lie,"
4461,281,"beware, lest this little brook of life,"
4462,281,some burning noon go dry!
4463,282,203
4464,282,""
4465,282,"he forgot—and i—remembered—"
4466,282,"'twas an everyday affair—"
4467,282,"long ago as christ and peter—"
4468,282,"""warmed them"" at the ""temple fire,"""
4469,282,""
4470,282,"""thou wert with him""—quoth ""the damsel""?"

4472,282,"jesus merely ""looked"" at peter—"
4473,282,could i do aught else—to thee?
4474,283,759
4475,283,""
4476,283,"he fought like those who've nought to lose—"
4477,283,"bestowed himself to balls"
4478,283,"as one who for a further life"
4479,283,had not a further use—
4480,283,""
4481,283,"invited death—with bold attempt—"
4482,283,"but death was coy of him"
4483,283,"as other men, were coy of death—"
4484,283,to him—to live—was doom—
4485,283,""
4486,283,"his comrades, shifted like the flakes"
4487,283,"when gusts reverse the snow—"
4488,283,"but he—was left alive because"
4489,283,of greediness to die—
4490,284,603
4491,284,""
4492,284,"he found my being—set it up—"
4493,284,"adjusted it to place—"
4494,284,"then carved his name—upon it—"
4495,284,and bade it to the east
4496,284,""
4497,284,"be faithful—in his absence—"
4498,284,"and he would come again—"
4499,284,"with equipage of amber—"
4500,284,that time—to take it home—
4501,285,"he fumbles at your spirit"
4502,285,"  as players at the keys"
4503,285,"before they drop full music on;"
4504,285,"  he stuns you by degrees,"
4505,285,""
4506,285,"prepares your brittle substance"
4507,285,"  for the ethereal blow,"
4508,285,"by fainter hammers, further heard,"
4509,285,"  then nearer, then so slow"
4510,285,""
4511,285,"your breath has time to straighten,"
4512,285,"  your brain to bubble cool, --"
4513,285,"deals one imperial thunderbolt"
4514,285,"  that scalps your naked soul,"
4515,286,567
4516,286,""
4517,286,"he gave away his life—"
4518,286,"to us—gigantic sum—"
4519,286,"a trifle—in his own esteem—"
4520,286,but magnified—by fame—
4521,286,""
4522,286,"until it burst the hearts"
4523,286,"that fancied they could hold—"
4524,286,"when swift it slipped its limit—"
4525,286,and on the heavens—unrolled—
4526,286,""
4527,286,"'tis ours—to wince—and weep—"
4528,286,"and wonder—and decay"
4529,286,"by blossoms gradual process—"
4530,286,he chose—maturity—
4531,286,""
4532,286,"and quickening—as we sowed—"
4533,286,"just obviated bud—"
4534,286,"and when we turned to note the growth—"
4535,286,broke—perfect—from the pod—
4536,287,865
4537,287,""
4538,287,"he outstripped time with but a bout,"
4539,287,"he outstripped stars and sun"
4540,287,"and then, unjaded, challenged god"
4541,287,"in presence of the throne,"
4542,287,""
4543,287,"and he and he in mighty list"
4544,287,"unto this present, run,"
4545,287,"the larger glory for the less"
4546,287,"a just sufficient ring,"
4547,288,517
4548,288,""
4549,288,"he parts himself—like leaves—"
4550,288,"and then—he closes up—"
4551,288,"then stands upon the bonnet"
4552,288,of any buttercup—
4553,288,""
4554,288,"and then he runs against"
4555,288,"and oversets a rose—"
4556,288,"and then does nothing—"
4557,288,then away upon a jib—he goes—
4558,288,""
4559,288,"and dangles like a mote"
4560,288,"suspended in the noon—"
4561,288,"uncertain—to return below—"
4562,288,or settle in the moon—
4563,288,""
4564,288,"what come of him—at night—"
4565,288,"the privilege to say"
4566,288,"be limited by ignorance—"

4569,288,"the frost—possess the world—"
4570,288,"in cabinets—be shown—"
4571,288,"a sepulchre of quaintest floss—"
4572,288,an abbey—a cocoon—
4573,289,273
4574,289,""
4575,289,"he put the belt around my life"
4576,289,"i heard the buckle snap—"
4577,289,"and turned away, imperial,"
4578,289,"my lifetime folding up—"
4579,289,"deliberate, as a duke would do"
4580,289,"a kingdom's title deed—"
4581,289,"henceforth, a dedicated sort—"
4582,289,"a member of the cloud,"
4583,289,""
4584,289,"yet not too far to come at call—"
4585,289,"and do the little toils"
4586,289,"that make the circuit of the rest—"
4587,289,"and deal occasional smiles"
4588,289,"to lives that stoop to notice mine—"
4589,289,"and kindly ask it in—"
4590,289,"whose invitation, know you not"
4591,289,for whom i must decline?
4592,290,497
4593,290,""
4594,290,"he strained my faith—"
4595,290,"did he find it supple?"
4596,290,"shook my strong trust—"
4597,290,did it then—yield?
4598,290,""
4599,290,"hurled my belief—"
4600,290,"but—did he shatter—it?"
4601,290,"racked—with suspense—"
4602,290,not a nerve failed!
4603,290,""
4604,290,"wrung me—with anguish—"

4607,290,he did never say—
4608,290,""
4609,290,"stabbed—while i sued"
4610,290,"his sweet forgiveness—"
4611,290,"jesus—it's your little ""john""!"
4612,290,don't you know—me?
4613,291,763
4614,291,""
4615,291,"he told a homely tale"
4616,291,"and spotted it with tears—"
4617,291,"upon his infant face was set"
4618,291,the cicatrice of years—
4619,291,""
4620,291,"all crumpled was the cheek"
4621,291,"no other kiss had known"

4625,291,"if mother—in the grave—"
4626,291,"or father—on the sea—"

4634,292,506
4635,292,""
4636,292,"he touched me, so i live to know"
4637,292,"that such a day, permitted so,"
4638,292,"i groped upon his breast—"
4639,292,"it was a boundless place to me"
4640,292,"and silenced, as the awful sea"
4641,292,"puts minor streams to rest,"
4642,292,""
4643,292,"and now, i'm different from before,"
4644,292,"as if i breathed superior air—"
4645,292,"or brushed a royal gown—"
4646,292,"my feet, too, that had wandered so—"
4647,292,"my gypsy face—transfigured now—"
4648,292,to tenderer renown—

5478,340,"possibly, this moment—"
5479,340,while i—dream—here—
5480,341,818
5481,341,""

5504,343,"i could suffice for him, i knew—"
5505,343,"he—could suffice for me—"

5528,344,convicted me—of me—
5529,344,""
5530,344,"so long i fainted, to myself"
5531,344,"it seemed the common way,"
5532,344,"and health, and laughter, curious things—"
5533,344,"to look at, like a toy—"
5534,344,""
5535,344,"to sometimes hear ""rich people"" buy"
5536,344,"and see the parcel rolled—"
5537,344,"and carried, i supposed—to heaven,"
5538,344,"for children, made of gold—"
5539,344,""
5540,344,"but not to touch, or wish for,"
5541,344,"or think of, with a sigh—"
5542,344,"and so and so—had been to me,"
5543,344,"had god willed differently,"
5544,344,""
5545,344,"i wish i knew that woman's name—"
5546,344,"so when she comes this way,"
5547,344,"to hold my life, and hold my ears"
5548,344,for fear i hear her say
5549,344,""
5550,344,"she's ""sorry i am dead""—again—"
5551,344,"just when the grave and i—"
5552,344,"have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,"
5553,344,our only lullaby—
5554,345,550
5555,345,""
5556,345,"i cross till i am weary"
5557,345,"a mountain—in my mind—"
5558,345,"more mountains—then a sea—"
5559,345,"more seas—and then"
5560,345,a desert—find—
5561,345,""
5562,345,"and my horizon blocks"
5563,345,"with steady—drifting—grains"
5564,345,"of unconjectured quantity—"
5565,345,as asiatic rains—
5566,345,""
5567,345,"nor this—defeat my pace—"
5568,345,"it hinder from the west"
5569,345,"but as an enemy's salute"
5570,345,one hurrying to rest—
5571,345,""
5572,345,"what merit had the goal—"
5573,345,"except there intervene"
5574,345,"faint doubt—and far competitor—"
5575,345,to jeopardize the gain?
5576,345,""
5577,345,"at last—the grace in sight—"
5578,345,"i shout unto my feet—"
5579,345,"i offer them the whole of heaven"
5580,345,the instant that we meet—
5581,345,""
5582,345,"they strive—and yet delay—"
5583,345,"they perish—do we die—"
5584,345,"or is this death's experiment—"
5585,345,reversed—in victory?
5586,346,"i died for beauty—but was scarce"
5587,346,"adjusted in the tomb"
5588,346,"when one who died for truth, was lain"
5589,346,in an adjoining room—
5590,346,""
5591,346,"he questioned softly ""why i failed""?"
5592,346,"""for beauty"", i replied—"
5593,346,"""and i—for truth—themself are one—"
5594,346,"we brethren, are"", he said—"
5595,346,""
5596,346,"and so, as kinsmen, met a night—"
5597,346,"we talked between the rooms—"
5598,346,"until the moss had reached our lips—"
5599,346,and covered up—our names—
5600,347,348
5601,347,""
5602,347,"i dreaded that first robin, so,"
5603,347,"but he is mastered, now,"
5604,347,"i'm accustomed to him grown,"
5605,347,"he hurts a little, though—"
5606,347,""
5607,347,"i thought if i could only live"
5608,347,"till that first shout got by—"
5609,347,"not all pianos in the woods"
5610,347,had power to mangle me—
5611,347,""
5612,347,"i dared not meet the daffodils—"
5613,347,"for fear their yellow gown"
5614,347,"would pierce me with a fashion"
5615,347,so foreign to my own—
5616,347,""
5617,347,"i wished the grass would hurry—"
5618,347,"so—when 'twas time to see—"
5619,347,"he'd be too tall, the tallest one"
5620,347,could stretch—to look at me—
5621,347,""
5622,347,"i could not bear the bees should come,"
5623,347,"i wished they'd stay away"
5624,347,"in those dim countries where they go,"
5625,347,"what word had they, for me?"
5626,347,""
5627,347,"they're here, though; not a creature failed—"
5628,347,"no blossom stayed away"
5629,347,"in gentle deference to me—"
5630,347,the queen of calvary—
5631,347,""
5632,347,"each one salutes me, as he goes,"
5633,347,"and i, my childish plumes,"
5634,347,"lift, in bereaved acknowledgment"
5635,347,of their unthinking drums—
5636,348,657
5637,348,""
5638,348,"i dwell in possibility—"
5639,348,"a fairer house than prose—"
5640,348,"more numerous of windows—"
5641,348,superior—for doors—
5642,348,""
5643,348,"of chambers as the cedars—"
5644,348,"impregnable of eye—"
5645,348,"and for an everlasting roof"
5646,348,the gambrels of the sky—
5647,348,""
5648,348,"of visitors—the fairest—"
5649,348,"for occupation—this—"
5650,348,"the spreading wide of narrow hands"
5651,348,to gather paradise—
5652,349,498
5653,349,""
5654,349,"i envy seas, whereon he rides—"
5655,349,"i envy spokes of wheels"
5656,349,"of chariots, that him convey—"
5657,349,i envy crooked hills
5658,349,""
5659,349,"that gaze upon his journey—"
5660,349,"how easy all can see"
5661,349,"what is forbidden utterly"
5662,349,as heaven—unto me!
5663,349,""
5664,349,"i envy nests of sparrows—"
5665,349,"that dot his distant eaves—"
5666,349,"the wealthy fly, upon his pane—"
5667,349,the happy—happy leaves—
5668,349,""
5669,349,"that just abroad his window"
5670,349,"have summer's leave to play—"
5671,349,"the ear rings of pizarro"
5672,349,could not obtain for me—
5673,349,""
5674,349,"i envy light—that wakes him—"
5675,349,"and bells—that boldly ring"
5676,349,"to tell him it is noon, abroad—"
5677,349,myself—be noon to him—
5678,349,""
5679,349,"yet interdict—my blossom—"
5680,349,"and abrogate—my bee—"
5681,349,"lest noon in everlasting night—"
5682,349,drop gabriel—and me—
5683,350,543
5684,350,""
5685,350,"i fear a man of frugal speech—"
5686,350,"i fear a silent man—"
5687,350,"haranguer—i can overtake—"
5688,350,or babbler—entertain—
5689,350,""
5690,350,"but he who weigheth—while the rest—"
5691,350,"expend their furthest pound—"
5692,350,"of this man—i am wary—"
5693,350,i fear that he is grand—
5694,351,"i felt a cleaving in my mind"
5695,351,"  as if my brain had split;"
5696,351,"i tried to match it, seam by seam,"
5697,351,"  but could not make them fit,"
5698,351,""
5699,351,"the thought behind i strove to join"
5700,351,"  unto the thought before,"
5701,351,"but sequence ravelled out of reach"
5702,351,"  like balls upon a floor,"
5703,352,"i felt a funeral, in my brain,"
5704,352,"and mourners to and fro"
5705,352,"kept treading—treading—till it seemed"
5706,352,that sense was breaking through—
5707,352,""
5708,352,"and when they all were seated,"
5709,352,"a service, like a drum—"
5710,352,"kept beating—beating—till i thought"
5711,352,my mind was going numb—
5712,352,""
5713,352,"and then i heard them lift a box"
5714,352,"and creak across my soul"
5715,352,"with those same boots of lead, again,"
5716,352,"then space—began to toll,"
5717,352,""
5718,352,"as all the heavens were a bell,"
5719,352,"and being, but an ear,"
5720,352,"and i, and silence, some strange race"
5721,352,"wrecked, solitary, here—"
5722,352,""
5723,352,"and then a plank in reason, broke,"
5724,352,"and i dropped down, and down—"
5725,352,"and hit a world, at every plunge,"
5726,352,and finished knowing—then—
5727,353,351
5728,353,""
5729,353,"i felt my life with both my hands"
5730,353,"to see if it was there—"
5731,353,"i held my spirit to the glass,"
5732,353,to prove it possibler—
5733,353,""
5734,353,"i turned my being round and round"
5735,353,"and paused at every pound"
5736,353,"to ask the owner's name—"
5737,353,"for doubt, that i should know the sound—"
5738,353,""
5739,353,"i judged my features—jarred my hair—"
5740,353,"i pushed my dimples by, and waited—"
5741,353,"if they—twinkled back—"
5742,353,"conviction might, of me—"
5743,353,""
5744,353,"i told myself, ""take courage, friend—"
5745,353,"that—was a former time—"
5746,353,"but we might learn to like the heaven,"
5747,353,"as well as our old home!"""
5748,354,"i found the phrase to every thought"
5749,354,"i ever had, but one;"
5750,354,"and that defies me,--as a hand"
5751,354,did try to chalk the sun
5752,354,""
5753,354,"to races nurtured in the dark;--"
5754,354,"how would your own begin?"
5755,354,"can blaze be done in cochineal,"
5756,354,or noon in mazarin?
5757,355,359
5758,355,""
5759,355,"i gained it so—"
5760,355,"by climbing slow—"
5761,355,"by catching at the twigs that grow"
5762,355,"between the bliss—and me—"
5763,355,"it hung so high"
5764,355,"as well the sky"
5765,355,attempt by strategy—
5766,355,""
5767,355,"i said i gained it—"
5768,355,"this—was all—"
5769,355,"look, how i clutch it"
5770,355,"lest it fall—"
5771,355,"and i a pauper go—"
5772,355,"unfitted by an instant's grace"
5773,355,"for the contented—beggar's face"
5774,355,i wore—an hour ago—
5775,356,580
5776,356,""
5777,356,"i gave myself to him—"
5778,356,"and took himself, for pay,"
5779,356,"the solemn contract of a life"
5780,356,"was ratified, this way—"
5781,356,""
5782,356,"the wealth might disappoint—"
5783,356,"myself a poorer prove"

5790,356,the subtle cargoes—lie—
5791,356,""
5792,356,"at least—'tis mutual—risk—"
5793,356,"some—found it—mutual gain—"
5794,356,"sweet debt of life—each night to owe—"
5795,356,insolvent—every noon—
5796,357,293
5797,357,""
5798,357,"i got so i could take his name—"
5799,357,"without—tremendous gain—"
5800,357,"that stop-sensation—on my soul—"
5801,357,and thunder—in the room—
5802,357,""
5803,357,"i got so i could walk across"
5804,357,"that angle in the floor,"
5805,357,"where he turned so, and i turned—how—"
5806,357,and all our sinew tore—
5807,357,""
5808,357,"i got so i could stir the box—"
5809,357,"in which his letters grew"
5810,357,"without that forcing, in my breath—"
5811,357,as staples—driven through—
5812,357,""
5813,357,"could dimly recollect a grace—"
5814,357,"i think, they call it ""god""—"
5815,357,"renowned to ease extremity—"
5816,357,"when formula, had failed—"

5829,357,"itself, too vast, for interrupting—more—"
5830,358,23
5831,358,""
5832,358,"i had a guinea golden—"

5834,358,"and tho' the sum was simple"
5835,358,"and pounds were in the land—"

5838,358,"that when i could not find it—"
5839,358,"i sat me down to sigh,"
5840,358,""
5841,358,"i had a crimson robin—"
5842,358,"who sang full many a day"

5873,359,"my noon had come—to dine—"
5874,359,"i trembling drew the table near—"
5875,359,and touched the curious wine—
5876,359,""
5877,359,"'twas this on tables i had seen—"
5878,359,"when turning, hungry, home"
5879,359,"i looked in windows, for the wealth"
5880,359,i could not hope—for mine—
5881,359,""
5882,359,"i did not know the ample bread—"
5883,359,"'twas so unlike the crumb"

5885,359,in nature's—dining room—
5886,359,""
5887,359,"the plenty hurt me—'twas so new—"
5888,359,"myself felt ill—and odd—"

5891,359,""
5892,359,"nor was i hungry—so i found"

5895,359,the entering—takes away—
5896,360,"i had no cause to be awake—"
5897,360,"my best—was gone to sleep—"
5898,360,"and morn a new politeness took—"
5899,360,and failed to wake them up—
5900,360,""
5901,360,"but called the others—clear—"
5902,360,"and passed their curtains by—"
5903,360,"sweet morning—when i oversleep—"

5911,360,"'twas such an ample peace—"
5912,360,"it could not hold a sigh—"
5913,360,"'twas sabbath—with the bells divorced—"
5914,360,'twas sunset—all the day—
5915,360,""
5916,360,"so choosing but a gown—"
5917,360,"and taking but a prayer—"
5918,360,"the only raiment i should need—"
5919,360,i struggled—and was there—

5926,361,"some industry must be,"

5929,362,398
5930,362,""
5931,362,"i had not minded—walls—"
5932,362,"were universe—one rock—"

5939,362,the looking in his eyes—
5940,362,""
5941,362,"but 'tis a single hair—"
5942,362,"a filament—a law—"

5951,363,""
5952,363,"i had some things that i called mine—"

6021,366,"half glad when it is night, and sleep,"

6095,369,"i willed my keepsakes -- signed away"
6096,369,"what portion of me be"

6099,369,""
6100,369,"with blue -- uncertain stumbling buzz --"
6101,369,"between the light -- and me --"
6102,369,"and then the windows failed -- and then"

6104,370,245
6105,370,""
6106,370,"i held a jewel in my fingers—"
6107,370,"and went to sleep—"

6120,371,"almost a loneliness,"

6137,373,"recording briefly, ""lost,"""

6139,373,"but when the south wind stirs the pools"
6140,373,"and struggles in the lanes,"
6141,373,"her heart missives her for her vow,"
6142,373,and she pours soft refrains
6143,373,""
6144,373,"into the lap of adamant,"
6145,373,"and spices, and the dew,"
6146,373,"that stiffens quietly to quartz"
6147,373,"upon her amber shoe,"
6148,374,372

6163,375,"wooden barred,"
6164,375,"and windows hanging low,"
6165,375,"inviting to—"
6166,375,"a portico,"

6169,375,"the other peep—"
6170,375,"to make sure all's asleep—"

6174,375,"how orderly the kitchen'd look, by night,"
6175,375,"with just a clock—"
6176,375,"but they could gag the tick—"

6180,375,""
6181,375,"a pair of spectacles ajar just stir—"

6184,375,"or a nervous star?"
6185,375,"the moon—slides down the stair,"

6190,375,"earring—or stone—"
6191,375,"a watch—some ancient brooch"

6193,375,staid sleeping—there—
6194,375,""
6195,375,"day—rattles—too"

6200,375,"""who's there""?"

6232,377,and pebble—safely plays—
6233,377,""
6234,377,"it's made of fathoms—and a belt—"
6235,377,"a belt of jagged stone—"
6236,377,"inlaid with emerald—half way down—"

6243,377,""
6244,377,"i read in an old fashioned book"
6245,377,"that people ""thirst no more""—"
6246,377,"the wells have buckets to them there—"
6247,377,it must mean that—i'm sure—
6248,377,""
6249,377,"shall we remember parching—then?"
6250,377,"those waters sound so grand—"
6251,377,"i think a little well—like mine—"
6252,377,dearer to understand—
6253,378,944
6254,378,""
6255,378,"i learned—at least—what home could be—"
6256,378,"how ignorant i had been"
6257,378,"of pretty ways of covenant—"
6258,378,how awkward at the hymn
6259,378,""
6260,378,"round our new fireside—but for this—"
6261,378,"this pattern—of the way—"
6262,378,"whose memory drowns me, like the dip"
6263,378,of a celestial sea—
6264,378,""
6265,378,"what mornings in our garden—guessed—"
6266,378,"what bees—for us—to hum—"
6267,378,"with only birds to interrupt"
6268,378,the ripple of our theme—
6269,378,""
6270,378,"and task for both—"
6271,378,"when play be done—"
6272,378,"your problem—of the brain—"
6273,378,"and mine—some foolisher effect—"
6274,378,a ruffle—or a tune—
6275,378,""
6276,378,"the afternoons—together spent—"
6277,378,"and twilight—in the lanes—"
6278,378,"some ministry to poorer lives—"
6279,378,seen poorest—thro' our gains—
6280,378,""
6281,378,and then return—and night—and home—
6282,378,""
6283,378,"and then away to you to pass—"
6284,378,"a new—diviner—care—"
6285,378,"till sunrise take us back to scene—"
6286,378,transmuted—vivider—
6287,378,""
6288,378,"this seems a home—"
6289,378,"and home is not—"
6290,378,"but what that place could be—"
6291,378,"afflicts me—as a setting sun—"
6292,378,where dawn—knows how to be—
6293,379,241
6294,379,""
6295,379,"i like a look of agony,"
6296,379,"because i know it's true—"
6297,379,"men do not sham convulsion,"
6298,379,"nor simulate, a throe—"
6299,379,""
6300,379,"the eyes glaze once—and that is death—"
6301,379,"impossible to feign"
6302,379,"the beads upon the forehead"
6303,379,"by homely anguish strung,"
6304,380,"i like to see it lap the miles—"
6305,380,"and lick the valleys up—"
6306,380,"and stop to feed itself at tanks—"
6307,380,and then—prodigious step
6308,380,""
6309,380,"around a pile of mountains—"
6310,380,"and supercilious peer"
6311,380,"in shanties—by the sides of roads—"
6312,380,and then a quarry pare
6313,380,""
6314,380,"to fit its ribs"
6315,380,"and crawl between"
6316,380,"complaining all the while"
6317,380,"in horrid—hooting stanza—"
6318,380,then chase itself down hill—
6319,380,""
6320,380,"and neigh like boanerges—"
6321,380,"then—punctual as a star"
6322,380,"stop—docile and omnipotent"
6323,380,at its own stable door—
6324,381,463
6325,381,""
6326,381,"i live with him—i see his face—"
6327,381,"i go no more away"
6328,381,"for visitor—or sundown—"
6329,381,death's single privacy
6330,381,""
6331,381,"the only one—forestalling mine—"
6332,381,"and that—by right that he"
6333,381,"presents a claim invisible—"
6334,381,no wedlock—granted me—
6335,381,""
6336,381,"i live with him—i hear his voice—"
6337,381,"i stand alive—today—"
6338,381,"to witness to the certainty"
6339,381,of immortality—
6340,381,""
6341,381,"taught me—by time—the lower way—"
6342,381,"conviction—every day—"
6343,381,"that life like this—is stopless—"
6344,381,be judgment—what it may—
6345,382,"i lived on dread; to those who know"
6346,382,"the stimulus there is"
6347,382,"in danger, other impetus"
6348,382,"is numb and vital-less,"
6349,382,""
6350,382,"as't were a spur upon the soul,"
6351,382,"a fear will urge it where"
6352,382,"to go without the spectre's aid"
6353,382,"were challenging despair,"
6354,383,181
6355,383,""
6356,383,"i lost a world - the other day!"
6357,383,"has anybody found?"
6358,383,"you'll know it by the row of stars"
6359,383,"around its forehead bound,"
6360,383,""
6361,383,"a rich man—might not notice it—"
6362,383,"yet—to my frugal eye,"
6363,383,"of more esteem than ducats—"
6364,383,oh find it—sir—for me!
6365,384,843
6366,384,""
6367,384,"i made slow riches but my gain"
6368,384,"was steady as the sun"
6369,384,"and every night, it numbered more"
6370,384,than the preceding one
6371,384,""
6372,384,"all days, i did not earn the same"
6373,384,"but my perceiveless gain"
6374,384,"inferred the less by growing than"
6375,384,"the sum that it had grown,"
6376,385,909
6377,385,""
6378,385,"i make his crescent fill or lack—"
6379,385,"his nature is at full"
6380,385,"or quarter—as i signify—"
6381,385,his tides—do i control—
6382,385,""
6383,385,"he holds superior in the sky"
6384,385,"or gropes, at my command"
6385,385,"behind inferior clouds—or round"
6386,385,a mist's slow colonnade—
6387,385,""
6388,385,"but since we hold a mutual disc—"
6389,385,"and front a mutual day—"
6390,385,"which is the despot, neither knows—"
6391,385,nor whose—the tyranny—
6392,386,739
6393,386,""
6394,386,"i many times thought peace had come"
6395,386,"when peace was far away—"
6396,386,"as wrecked men—deem they sight the land—"
6397,386,at centre of the sea—
6398,386,""
6399,386,"and struggle slacker—but to prove"
6400,386,"as hopelessly as i—"
6401,386,"how many the fictitious shores—"
6402,386,before the harbor be—
6403,387,718
6404,387,""
6405,387,"i meant to find her when i came—"
6406,387,"death—had the same design—"
6407,387,"but the success—was his—it seems—"
6408,387,and the surrender—mine—
6409,387,""
6410,387,"i meant to tell her how i longed"
6411,387,"for just this single time—"
6412,387,"but death had told her so the first—"
6413,387,"and she had past, with him—"
6414,387,""
6415,387,"to wander—now—is my repose—"
6416,387,"to rest—to rest would be"
6417,387,"a privilege of hurricane"
6418,387,"to memory—and me,"
6419,388,476
6420,388,""
6421,388,"i meant to have but modest needs—"
6422,388,"such as content—and heaven—"
6423,388,"within my income—these could lie"
6424,388,and life and i—keep even—
6425,388,""
6426,388,"but since the last—included both—"
6427,388,"it would suffice my prayer"
6428,388,"but just for one—to stipulate—"
6429,388,and grace would grant the pair—
6430,388,""
6431,388,"and so—upon this wise—i prayed—"
6432,388,"great spirit—give to me"
6433,388,"a heaven not so large as yours,"
6434,388,but large enough—for me—
6435,388,""
6436,388,"a smile suffused jehovah's face—"
6437,388,"the cherubim—withdrew—"
6438,388,"grave saints stole out to look at me—"
6439,388,and showed their dimples—too—
6440,388,""
6441,388,"i left the place, with all my might—"
6442,388,"i threw my prayer away—"
6443,388,"the quiet ages picked it up—"
6444,388,"and judgment—twinkled—too—"
6445,388,"tat one so honest—be extant—"
6446,388,"it take the tale for true—"
6447,388,"that ""whatsoever ye shall ask—"
6448,388,"itself be given you""—"
6449,388,""
6450,388,"but i, grown shrewder—scan the skies"
6451,388,"with a suspicious air—"
6452,388,"as children—swindled for the first"
6453,388,all swindlers—be—infer—
6454,389,"i measure every grief i meet"
6455,389,"  with analytic eyes;"
6456,389,"i wonder if it weighs like mine,"
6457,389,"  or has an easier size,"
6458,389,""
6459,389,"i wonder if they bore it long,"
6460,389,"  or did it just begin?"
6461,389,"i could not tell the date of mine,"
6462,389,"  it feels so old a pain,"
6463,389,""
6464,389,"i wonder if it hurts to live,"
6465,389,"  and if they have to try,"
6466,389,"and whether, could they choose between,"
6467,389,"  they would not rather die,"
6468,389,""
6469,389,"i wonder if when years have piled--"
6470,389,"  some thousands--on the cause"
6471,389,"of early hurt, if such a lapse"
6472,389,  could give them any pause;
6473,389,""
6474,389,"or would they go on aching still"
6475,389,"  through centuries above,"
6476,389,"enlightened to a larger pain"
6477,389,"  by contrast with the love,"
6478,389,""
6479,389,"the grieved are many, i am told;"
6480,389,"  the reason deeper lies,--"
6481,389,"death is but one and comes but once"
6482,389,"  and only nails the eyes,"
6483,389,""
6484,389,"there's grief of want, and grief of cold,--"
6485,389,"  a sort they call 'despair,'"
6486,389,"there's banishment from native eyes,"
6487,389,"  in sight of native air,"
6488,389,""
6489,389,"and though i may not guess the kind"
6490,389,"  correctly yet to me"
6491,389,"a piercing comfort it affords"
6492,389,"  in passing calvary,"
6493,389,""
6494,389,"to note the fashions of the cross"
6495,389,"  of those that stand alone"
6496,389,"still fascinated to presume"
6497,389,"  that some are like my own,"
6498,390,166
6499,390,""
6500,390,"i met a king this afternoon!"
6501,390,"he had not on a crown indeed,"
6502,390,"a little palmleaf hat was all,"
6503,390,"and he was barefoot, i'm afraid!"
6504,390,""
6505,390,"but sure i am he ermine wore"
6506,390,"beneath his faded jacket's blue—"
6507,390,"and sure i am, the crest he bore"
6508,390,within that jacket's pocket too!
6509,390,""
6510,390,"for 'twas too stately for an earl—"
6511,390,"a marquis would not go so grand!"
6512,390,"'twas possibly a czar petite—"
6513,390,"a pope, or something of that kind!"
6514,390,""
6515,390,"if i must tell you, of a horse"
6516,390,"my freckled monarch held the rein—"
6517,390,"doubtless an estimable beast,"
6518,390,but not at all disposed to run!
6519,390,""
6520,390,"and such a wagon! while i live"
6521,390,"dare i presume to see"
6522,390,"another such a vehicle"
6523,390,as then transported me!
6524,390,""
6525,390,"two other ragged princes"
6526,390,"his royal state partook!"
6527,390,"doubtless the first excursion"
6528,390,these sovereigns ever took!
6529,390,""
6530,390,"i question if the royal coach"
6531,390,"round which the footmen wait"
6532,390,"has the significance, on high,"
6533,390,of this barefoot estate!
6534,391,413
6535,391,""
6536,391,"i never felt at home—below—-"
6537,391,"and in the handsome skies"
6538,391,"i shall not feel at home—i know—"
6539,391,i don't like paradise—
6540,391,""
6541,391,"because it's sunday—all the time—"
6542,391,"and recess—never comes—"
6543,391,"and eden'll be so lonesome"
6544,391,bright wednesday afternoons—
6545,391,""
6546,391,"if god could make a visit—"
6547,391,"or ever took a nap—"
6548,391,"so not to see us—but they say"
6549,391,himself—a telescope
6550,391,""
6551,391,"perennial beholds us—"
6552,391,"myself would run away"
6553,391,"from him—and holy ghost—and all—"
6554,391,"but there's the ""judgement day""!"
6555,392,"i never hear the word ""escape"""
6556,392,"without a quicker blood,"
6557,392,"a sudden expectation,"
6558,392,"a flying attitude,"
6559,392,""
6560,392,"i never hear of prisons broad"
6561,392,"by soldiers battered down,"
6562,392,"but i tug childish at my bars, --"
6563,392,only to fail again!
6564,393,49
6565,393,""
6566,393,"i never lost as much but twice,"
6567,393,"and that was in the sod,"

6569,393,before the door of god!
6570,393,""
6571,393,"angels—twice descending"

6578,394,"and what a billow be,"
6579,394,""
6580,394,"i never spoke with god,"

6583,394,"as if the checks were given,"
6584,395,11
6585,395,""
6586,395,"i never told the buried gold"
6587,395,"upon the hill—that lies—"
6588,395,"i saw the sun—his plunder done"
6589,395,"crouch low to guard his prize,"
6590,395,""
6591,395,"he stood as near"
6592,395,"as stood you here—"
6593,395,"a pace had been between—"
6594,395,"did but a snake bisect the brake"
6595,395,"my life had forfeit been,"
6596,395,""
6597,395,"that was a wondrous booty—"
6598,395,"i hope 'twas honest gained,"
6599,395,"those were the fairest ingots"
6600,395,that ever kissed the spade!
6601,395,""
6602,395,"whether to keep the secret—"
6603,395,"whether to reveal—"
6604,395,"whether as i ponder"

6606,395,""
6607,395,"could a shrewd advise me"

6611,396,51
6612,396,""
6613,396,"i often passed the village"
6614,396,"when going home from school—"
6615,396,"and wondered what they did there—"
6616,396,and why it was so still—
6617,396,""
6618,396,"i did not know the year then—"
6619,396,"in which my call would come—"
6620,396,"earlier, by the dial,"
6621,396,"than the rest have gone,"
6622,396,""
6623,396,"it's stiller than the sundown,"
6624,396,"it's cooler than the dawn—"
6625,396,"the daisies dare to come here—"
6626,396,and birds can flutter down—
6627,396,""
6628,396,"so when you are tired—"
6629,396,"or perplexed—or cold—"
6630,396,"trust the loving promise"

6633,396,and i will enfold!

6635,397,""
6636,397,"i pay—in satin cash—"
6637,397,"you did not state—your price—"
6638,397,"a petal, for a paragraph"
6639,397,it near as i can guess—
6640,398,801
6641,398,""
6642,398,"i play at riches—to appease"
6643,398,"the clamoring for gold—"
6644,398,"it kept me from a thief, i think,"
6645,398,"for often, overbold"
6646,398,""
6647,398,"with want, and opportunity—"
6648,398,"i could have done a sin"
6649,398,"and been myself that easy thing"
6650,398,an independent man—
6651,398,""
6652,398,"but often as my lot displays"
6653,398,"too hungry to be borne"
6654,398,"i deem myself what i would be—"
6655,398,and novel comforting
6656,398,""
6657,398,"my poverty and i derive—"
6658,398,"we question if the man—"

6660,398,as we—who never can—
6661,398,""
6662,398,"should ever these exploring hands"
6663,398,"chance sovereign on a mine—"
6664,398,"or in the long—uneven term"
6665,398,"to win, become their turn—"
6666,398,""
6667,398,"how fitter they will be—for want—"
6668,398,"enlightening so well—"
6669,398,"i know not which, desire, or grant—"
6670,398,be wholly beautiful—
6671,399,576
6672,399,""
6673,399,"i prayed, at first, a little girl,"
6674,399,"because they told me to—"
6675,399,"but stopped, when qualified to guess"
6676,399,how prayer would feel—to me—
6677,399,""
6678,399,"if i believed god looked around,"
6679,399,"each time my childish eye"
6680,399,"fixed full, and steady, on his own"
6681,399,in childish honesty—
6682,399,""
6683,399,"and told him what i'd like, today,"
6684,399,"and parts of his far plan"
6685,399,"that baffled me—"
6686,399,"the mingled side"
6687,399,of his divinity—
6688,399,""
6689,399,"and often since, in danger,"
6690,399,"i count the force 'twould be"
6691,399,"to have a god so strong as that"
6692,399,to hold my life for me
6693,399,""
6694,399,"till i could take the balance"
6695,399,"that tips so frequent, now,"
6696,399,"it takes me all the while to poise—"
6697,399,and then—it doesn't stay—
6698,400,412
6699,400,""
6700,400,"i read my sentence—steadily—"
6701,400,"reviewed it with my eyes,"
6702,400,"to see that i made no mistake"
6703,400,"in its extremest clause—"
6704,400,"the date, and manner, of the shame—"
6705,400,"and then the pious form"
6706,400,"that ""god have mercy"" on the soul"
6707,400,"the jury voted him—"
6708,400,"i made my soul familiar—with her extremity—"
6709,400,"that at the last, it should not be a novel agony—"
6710,400,"but she, and death, acquainted—"
6711,400,"meet tranquilly, as friends—"
6712,400,"salute, and pass, without a hint—"
6713,400,"and there, the matter ends—"
6714,401,301
6715,401,""
6716,401,"i reason, earth is short—"
6717,401,"and anguish—absolute—"
6718,401,"and many hurt,"
6719,401,"but, what of that?"
6720,401,""
6721,401,"i reason, we could die—"
6722,401,"the best vitality"
6723,401,"cannot excel decay,"
6724,401,"but, what of that?"
6725,401,""
6726,401,"i reason, that in heaven—"
6727,401,"somehow, it will be even—"
6728,401,"some new equation, given—"
6729,401,"but, what of that?"
6730,402,569
6731,402,""
6732,402,"i reckon—when i count it all—"
6733,402,"first—poets—then the sun—"
6734,402,"then summer—then the heaven of god—"
6735,402,and then—the list is done—
6736,402,""
6737,402,"but, looking back—the first so seems"
6738,402,"to comprehend the whole—"
6739,402,"the others look a needless show—"
6740,402,so i write—poets—all—
6741,402,""
6742,402,"their summer—lasts a solid year—"
6743,402,"they can afford a sun"
6744,402,"the east—would deem extravagant—"
6745,402,and if the further heaven—
6746,402,""
6747,402,"be beautiful as they prepare"
6748,402,"for those who worship them—"
6749,402,"it is too difficult a grace—"
6750,402,to justify the dream—
6751,403,41
6752,403,""
6753,403,"i robbed the woods—"
6754,403,"the trusting woods,"
6755,403,"the unsuspecting trees"
6756,403,"brought out their burs and mosses"
6757,403,"my fantasy to please,"
6758,403,"i scanned their trinkets curious—i grasped—i bore away—"
6759,403,"what will the solemn hemlock—"
6760,403,what will the oak tree say?
6761,404,616
6762,404,""
6763,404,"i rose—because he sank—"
6764,404,"i thought it would be opposite—"
6765,404,"but when his power dropped—"
6766,404,"my soul grew straight,"
6767,404,""
6768,404,"i cheered my fainting prince—"
6769,404,"i sang firm—even—chants—"
6770,404,i helped his film—with hymn—
6771,404,""
6772,404,"and when the dews drew off"
6773,404,"that held his forehead stiff—"
6774,404,"i met him—"
6775,404,balm to balm—
6776,404,""
6777,404,"i told him best—must pass"
6778,404,"through this low arch of flesh—"
6779,404,"no casque so brave"
6780,404,it spurn the grave—
6781,404,""
6782,404,"i told him worlds i knew"
6783,404,"where emperors grew—"
6784,404,"who recollected us"
6785,404,if we were true—
6786,404,""
6787,404,"and so with thews of hymn—"
6788,404,"and sinew from within—"
6789,404,"and ways i knew not that i knew—till then—"
6790,404,i lifted him—
6791,405,378
6792,405,""
6793,405,"i saw no way—the heavens were stitched—"
6794,405,"i felt the columns close—"
6795,405,"the earth reversed her hemispheres—"
6796,405,i touched the universe—
6797,405,""
6798,405,"and back it slid—and i alone—"
6799,405,"a speck upon a ball—"
6800,405,"went out upon circumference—"
6801,405,beyond the dip of bell—
6802,406,"i see thee better—in the dark—"
6803,406,"i do not need a light—"
6804,406,"the love of thee—a prism be—"
6805,406,excelling violet—
6806,406,""
6807,406,"i see thee better for the years"
6808,406,"that hunch themselves between—"
6809,406,"the miner's lamp—sufficient be—"
6810,406,to nullify the mine—
6811,406,""
6812,406,"and in the grave—i see thee best—"
6813,406,"its little panels be"
6814,406,"aglow—all ruddy—with the light"
6815,406,"i held so high, for thee—"
6816,406,""
6817,406,"what need of day—"
6818,406,"to those whose dark—hath so—surpassing sun—"
6819,406,"it deem it be—continually—"
6820,406,at the meridian?
6821,407,308
6822,407,""
6823,407,"i send two sunsets—"
6824,407,"day and i—in competition ran—"
6825,407,"i finished two—and several stars—"
6826,407,while he—was making one—
6827,407,""
6828,407,"his own was ampler—but as i"
6829,407,"was saying to a friend—"
6830,407,"mine—is the more convenient"
6831,407,to carry in the hand—
6832,408,250
6833,408,""
6834,408,"i shall keep singing!"
6835,408,"birds will pass me"
6836,408,"on their way to yellower climes—"
6837,408,"each—with a robin's expectation—"
6838,408,"i—with my redbreast—"
6839,408,and my rhymes—
6840,408,""
6841,408,"late—when i take my place in summer—"
6842,408,"but—i shall bring a fuller tune—"
6843,408,"vespers—are sweeter than matins—signor—"
6844,408,morning—only the seed of noon—
6845,409,193
6846,409,""
6847,409,"i shall know why—when time is over—"
6848,409,"and i have ceased to wonder why—"
6849,409,"christ will explain each separate anguish"
6850,409,in the fair schoolroom of the sky—
6851,409,""
6852,409,"he will tell me what ""peter"" promised—"
6853,409,"and i—for wonder at his woe—"
6854,409,"i shall forget the drop of anguish"
6855,409,that scalds me now—that scalds me now!
6856,410,313
6857,410,""
6858,410,"i should have been too glad, i see—"
6859,410,"too lifted—for the scant degree"
6860,410,"of life's penurious round—"
6861,410,"my little circuit would have shamed"
6862,410,"this new circumference—have blamed—"
6863,410,"the homelier time behind,"
6864,410,""
6865,410,"i should have been too saved—i see—"
6866,410,"too rescued—fear too dim to me"
6867,410,"that i could spell the prayer"
6868,410,"i knew so perfect—yesterday—"
6869,410,"that scalding one—sabachthani—"
6870,410,recited fluent—here—
6871,410,""
6872,410,"earth would have been too much—i see—"

6885,411,""
6886,411,"i should not dare to leave my friend,"

6888,411,"while i was gone—and i—too late—"
6889,411,should reach the heart that wanted me—
6890,411,""
6891,411,"if i should disappoint the eyes"
6892,411,"that hunted—hunted so—to see—"
6893,411,"and could not bear to shut until"
6894,411,"they ""noticed"" me—they noticed me—"
6895,411,""
6896,411,"if i should stab the patient faith"

6904,411,where midnight frosts—had lain!
6905,412,446
6906,412,""
6907,412,"i showed her heights she never saw—"

6918,412,"and could she, further, ""no""?"
6919,413,850
6920,413,""
6921,413,"i sing to use the waiting"

6930,414,708
6931,414,""
6932,414,"i sometimes drop it, for a quick—"

6934,414,"anonymous delight to know—"
6935,414,and madder—to conceive—
6936,414,""

6939,414,"without an instant's respite—"
6940,414,'twould look too far—to die—
6941,415,"i started early - took my dog -"
6942,415,"and visited the sea -"
6943,415,"the mermaids in the basement"
6944,415,came out to look at me -
6945,415,""
6946,415,"and frigates - in the upper floor"
6947,415,"extended hempen hands -"
6948,415,"presuming me to be a mouse -"
6949,415,aground - upon the sands -
6950,415,""
6951,415,"but no man moved me - till the tide"
6952,415,"went past my simple shoe -"
6953,415,"and past my apron - and my belt"

6955,415,""
6956,415,"and made as he would eat me up -"

6960,415,""
6961,415,"and he - he followed - close behind -"

6969,415,at me - the sea withdrew -
6970,416,"i stepped from plank to plank"
6971,416,"  so slow and cautiously;"

6982,417,"because—thee—"
6983,417,"sweet plea—"
6984,417,he pardoned me!
6985,418,"i taste a liquor never brewed,"
6986,418,"from tankards scooped in pearl;"
6987,418,"not all the vats upon the rhine"

6990,418,"inebriate of air am i,"
6991,418,"and debauchee of dew,"

6993,418,"from inns of molten blue,"
6994,418,""
6995,418,"when the landlord turn the drunken bee"
6996,418,"out of the foxglove's door,"
6997,418,"when butterflies renounce their drams,"
6998,418,i shall but drink the more!
6999,418,""
7000,418,"till seraphs swing their snowy hats,"
7001,418,"and saints to windows run,"
7002,418,"to see the little tippler"
7003,418,leaning against the sun!
7004,419,339
7005,419,""
7006,419,"i tend my flowers for thee—"
7007,419,"bright absentee!"
7008,419,"my fuchsia's coral seams"
7009,419,rip—while the sower—dreams—
7010,419,""
7011,419,"geraniums—tint—and spot—"
7012,419,"low daisies—dot—"
7013,419,"my cactus—splits her beard"
7014,419,to show her throat—
7015,419,""
7016,419,"carnations—tip their spice—"
7017,419,"and bees—pick up—"
7018,419,"a hyacinth—i hid—"
7019,419,"puts out a ruffled head—"
7020,419,"and odors fall"
7021,419,"from flasks—so small—"
7022,419,you marvel how they held—
7023,419,""
7024,419,"globe roses—break their satin glake—"
7025,419,"upon my garden floor—"
7026,419,"yet—thou—not there—"
7027,419,"i had as lief they bore"
7028,419,no crimson—more—
7029,419,""
7030,419,"thy flower—be gay—"
7031,419,"her lord—away!"
7032,419,"it ill becometh me—"
7033,419,"i'll dwell in calyx—gray—"
7034,419,"how modestly—alway—"
7035,419,"thy daisy—"
7036,419,draped for thee!
7037,420,593
7038,420,""
7039,420,"i think i was enchanted"
7040,420,"when first a sombre girl—"
7041,420,"i read that foreign lady—"
7042,420,the dark—felt beautiful—
7043,420,""
7044,420,"and whether it was noon at night—"
7045,420,"or only heaven—at noon—"
7046,420,"for very lunacy of light"
7047,420,i had not power to tell—
7048,420,""
7049,420,"the bees—became as butterflies—"
7050,420,"the butterflies—as swans—"
7051,420,"approached—and spurned the narrow grass—"
7052,420,and just the meanest tunes
7053,420,""
7054,420,"that nature murmured to herself"
7055,420,"to keep herself in cheer—"
7056,420,"i took for giants—practising"
7057,420,titanic opera—
7058,420,""
7059,420,"the days—to mighty metres stept—"
7060,420,"the homeliest—adorned"
7061,420,"as if unto a jubilee"
7062,420,'twere suddenly confirmed—
7063,420,""
7064,420,"i could not have defined the change—"
7065,420,"conversion of the mind"
7066,420,"like sanctifying in the soul—"
7067,420,is witnessed—not explained—
7068,420,""
7069,420,"'twas a divine insanity—"
7070,420,"the danger to be sane"
7071,420,"should i again experience—"
7072,420,'tis antidote to turn—
7073,420,""
7074,420,"to tomes of solid witchcraft—"
7075,420,"magicians be asleep—"
7076,420,"but magic—hath an element"
7077,420,like deity—to keep—
7078,421,237
7079,421,""
7080,421,"i think just how my shape will rise—"
7081,421,"when i shall be ""forgiven""—"
7082,421,"till hair—and eyes—and timid head—"
7083,421,are out of sight—in heaven—
7084,421,""
7085,421,"i think just how my lips will weigh—"
7086,421,"with shapeless—quivering—prayer—"
7087,421,"that you—so late—""consider"" me—"
7088,421,"the ""sparrow"" of your care—"
7089,421,""
7090,421,"i mind me that of anguish—sent—"
7091,421,"some drifts were moved away—"
7092,421,"before my simple bosom—broke—"
7093,421,and why not this—if they?
7094,421,""
7095,421,"and so i con that thing—""forgiven""—"
7096,421,"until—delirious—borne—"
7097,421,"by my long bright—and longer—trust—"
7098,421,i drop my heart—unshriven!
7099,422,"i think the hemlock likes to stand"
7100,422,"upon a marge of snow—"
7101,422,"it suits his own austerity—"
7102,422,and satisfies an awe
7103,422,""
7104,422,"that men, must slake in wilderness—"
7105,422,"and in the desert—cloy—"
7106,422,"an instinct for the hoar, the bald—"
7107,422,lapland's—necessity—
7108,422,""
7109,422,"the hemlock's nature thrives—on cold—"
7110,422,"the gnash of northern winds"
7111,422,"is sweetest nutriment—to him—"
7112,422,his best norwegian wines—
7113,422,""
7114,422,"to satin races—he is nought—"
7115,422,"but children on the don,"
7116,422,"beneath his tabernacles, play,"
7117,422,"and dnieper wrestlers, run,"
7118,423,635
7119,423,""
7120,423,"i think the longest hour of all"
7121,423,"is when the cars have come—"
7122,423,"and we are waiting for the coach—"
7123,423,it seems as though the time
7124,423,""
7125,423,"indignant—that the joy was come—"
7126,423,"did block the gilded hands—"
7127,423,"and would not let the seconds by—"
7128,423,but slowest instant—ends—
7129,423,""
7130,423,"the pendulum begins to count—"
7131,423,"like little scholars—loud—"
7132,423,"the steps grow thicker—in the hall—"
7133,423,the heart begins to crowd—
7134,423,""
7135,423,"then i—my timid service done—"
7136,423,"tho' service 'twas, of love—"

7138,423,"and further north—remove,"
7139,424,646
7140,424,""
7141,424,"i think to live—may be a bliss"
7142,424,"to those who dare to try—"
7143,424,"beyond my limit to conceive—"
7144,424,my lip—to testify—
7145,424,""
7146,424,"i think the heart i former wore"
7147,424,"could widen—till to me"
7148,424,"the other, like the little bank"
7149,424,appear—unto the sea—
7150,424,""
7151,424,"i think the days—could every one"
7152,424,"in ordination stand—"
7153,424,"and majesty—be easier—"
7154,424,than an inferior kind—
7155,424,""
7156,424,"no numb alarm—lest difference come—"
7157,424,"no goblin—on the bloom—"
7158,424,"no start in apprehension's ear,"
7159,424,no bankruptcy—no doom—
7160,424,""
7161,424,"but certainties of sun—"
7162,424,"midsummer—in the mind—"
7163,424,"a steadfast south—upon the soul—"
7164,424,her polar time—behind—
7165,424,""
7166,424,"the vision—pondered long—"
7167,424,"so plausible becomes"
7168,424,"that i esteem the fiction—real—"
7169,424,the real—fictitious seems—
7170,424,""
7171,424,"how bountiful the dream—"
7172,424,"what plenty—it would be—"
7173,424,"had all my life but been mistake"
7174,424,just rectified—in thee
7175,425,443
7176,425,""
7177,425,"i tie my hat—i crease my shawl—"
7178,425,"life's little duties do—precisely—"
7179,425,"as the very least"
7180,425,were infinite—to me—
7181,425,""
7182,425,"i put new blossoms in the glass—"
7183,425,"and throw the old—away—"
7184,425,"i push a petal from my gown"
7185,425,"that anchored there—i weigh"
7186,425,"the time 'twill be till six o'clock"
7187,425,"i have so much to do—"
7188,425,"and yet—existence—some way back—"
7189,425,"stopped—struck—my tickling—through—"
7190,425,"we cannot put ourself away"
7191,425,"as a completed man"
7192,425,"or woman—when the errand's done"
7193,425,"we came to flesh—upon—"
7194,425,"there may be—miles on miles of nought—"
7195,425,"of action—sicker far—"
7196,425,"to simulate—is stinging work—"
7197,425,"to cover what we are"
7198,425,"from science—and from surgery—"
7199,425,"too telescopic eyes"
7200,425,"to bear on us unshaded—"
7201,425,"for their—sake—not for ours—"
7202,425,"'twould start them—"
7203,425,"we—could tremble—"
7204,425,"but since we got a bomb—"
7205,425,"and held it in our bosom—"
7206,425,nay—hold it—it is calm—
7207,425,""
7208,425,"therefore—we do life's labor—"
7209,425,"though life's reward—be done—"
7210,425,"with scrupulous exactness—"
7211,425,to hold our senses—on—
7212,426,540
7213,426,""
7214,426,"i took my power in my hand—"
7215,426,"and went against the world—"
7216,426,"'twas not so much as david—had—"
7217,426,but i—was twice as bold—
7218,426,""
7219,426,"i aimed by pebble—but myself"
7220,426,"was all the one that fell—"
7221,426,"was it goliath—was too large—"
7222,426,or was myself—too small?
7223,427,532
7224,427,""
7225,427,"i tried to think a lonelier thing"
7226,427,"than any i had seen—"
7227,427,"some polar expiation—an omen in the bone"
7228,427,of death's tremendous nearness—
7229,427,""
7230,427,"i probed retrieverless things"
7231,427,"my duplicate—to borrow—"
7232,427,a haggard comfort springs
7233,427,""
7234,427,"from the belief that somewhere—"
7235,427,"within the clutch of thought—"
7236,427,"there dwells one other creature"
7237,427,of heavenly love—forgot—
7238,427,""
7239,427,"i plucked at our partition"
7240,427,"as one should pry the walls—"
7241,427,"between himself—and horror's twin—"
7242,427,within opposing cells—
7243,427,""
7244,427,"i almost strove to clasp his hand,"
7245,427,"such luxury—it grew—"
7246,427,"that as myself—could pity him—"
7247,427,perhaps he—pitied me—
7248,428,"""i want""—it pleaded—all its life—"
7249,428,"i want—was chief it said"
7250,428,"when skill entreated it—the last—"
7251,428,and when so newly dead—
7252,428,""
7253,428,"i could not deem it late—to hear"
7254,428,"that single—steadfast sigh—"
7255,428,"the lips had placed as with a ""please"""
7256,428,toward eternity—
7257,429,486
7258,429,""
7259,429,"i was the slightest in the house—"
7260,429,"i took the smallest room—"
7261,429,"at night, my little lamp, and book—"
7262,429,and one geranium—
7263,429,""
7264,429,"so stationed i could catch the mint"
7265,429,"that never ceased to fall—"
7266,429,"and just my basket—"
7267,429,"let me think—i'm sure—"
7268,429,that this was all—
7269,429,""
7270,429,"i never spoke—unless addressed—"
7271,429,"and then, 'twas brief and low—"
7272,429,"i could not bear to live—aloud—"
7273,429,the racket shamed me so—
7274,429,""
7275,429,"and if it had not been so far—"
7276,429,"and any one i knew"
7277,429,"were going—i had often thought"
7278,429,how noteless—i could die—
7279,430,629
7280,430,""
7281,430,"i watched the moon around the house"
7282,430,"until upon a pane—"
7283,430,"she stopped—a traveller's privilege—for rest—"
7284,430,and there upon
7285,430,""
7286,430,"i gazed—as at a stranger—"
7287,430,"the lady in the town"
7288,430,"doth think no incivility"
7289,430,to lift her glass—upon—
7290,430,""
7291,430,"but never stranger justified"
7292,430,"the curiosity"
7293,430,"like mine—for not a foot—nor hand—"
7294,430,nor formula—had she—
7295,430,""
7296,430,"but like a head—a guillotine"
7297,430,"slid carelessly away—"
7298,430,"did independent, amber—"
7299,430,sustain her in the sky—
7300,430,""
7301,430,"or like a stemless flower—"
7302,430,"upheld in rolling air"
7303,430,"by finer gravitations—"
7304,430,than bind philosopher—
7305,430,""
7306,430,"no hunger—had she—nor an inn—"
7307,430,"her toilette—to suffice—"
7308,430,"nor avocation—nor concern"
7309,430,for little mysteries
7310,430,""
7311,430,"as harass us—like life—and death—"
7312,430,"and afterwards—or nay—"
7313,430,"but seemed engrossed to absolute—"
7314,430,with shining—and the sky—
7315,430,""
7316,430,"the privilege to scrutinize"
7317,430,"was scarce upon my eyes"
7318,430,"when, with a silver practise—"
7319,430,she vaulted out of gaze—
7320,430,""
7321,430,"and next—i met her on a cloud—"
7322,430,"myself too far below"
7323,430,"to follow her superior road—"
7324,430,or its advantage—blue—
7325,431,"i went to heaven,--"
7326,431,"'t was a small town,"
7327,431,"lit with a ruby,"
7328,431,"lathed with down,"
7329,431,"stiller than the fields"
7330,431,"at the full dew,"
7331,431,"beautiful as pictures"
7332,431,"no man drew,"
7333,431,"people like the moth,"
7334,431,"of mechlin, frames,"
7335,431,"duties of gossamer,"
7336,431,"and eider names,"
7337,431,"almost contented"
7338,431,"i could be"
7339,431,"'mong such unique"
7340,431,"society,"
7341,432,363
7342,432,""
7343,432,"i went to thank her—"
7344,432,"but she slept—"
7345,432,"her bed—a funneled stone—"
7346,432,"with nosegays at the head and foot—"
7347,432,that travellers—had thrown—
7348,432,""
7349,432,"who went to thank her—"
7350,432,"but she slept—"
7351,432,"'twas short—to cross the sea—"
7352,432,"to look upon her like—alive—"
7353,432,but turning back—'twas slow—
7354,433,16
7355,433,""
7356,433,"i would distill a cup,"
7357,433,"and bear to all my friends,"
7358,433,"drinking to her no more astir,"
7359,433,"by beck, or burn, or moor!"
7360,434,505
7361,434,""
7362,434,"i would not paint—a picture—"
7363,434,"i'd rather be the one"
7364,434,"its bright impossibility"
7365,434,"to dwell—delicious—on—"
7366,434,"and wonder how the fingers feel"
7367,434,"whose rare—celestial—stir—"
7368,434,"evokes so sweet a torment—"
7369,434,such sumptuous—despair—
7370,434,""
7371,434,"i would not talk, like cornets—"
7372,434,"i'd rather be the one"
7373,434,"raised softly to the ceilings—"
7374,434,"and out, and easy on—"
7375,434,"through villages of ether—"
7376,434,"myself endued balloon"
7377,434,"by but a lip of metal—"
7378,434,the pier to my pontoon—
7379,434,""
7380,434,"nor would i be a poet—"
7381,434,"it's finer—own the ear—"
7382,434,"enamored—impotent—content—"
7383,434,"the license to revere,"
7384,434,"a privilege so awful"
7385,434,"what would the dower be,"
7386,434,"had i the art to stun myself"
7387,434,with bolts of melody!
7388,435,"i years had been from home"
7389,435,"and now before the door"
7390,435,"i dared not enter, lest a face"
7391,435,i never saw before
7392,435,""
7393,435,"stare solid into mine"
7394,435,"and ask my business there—"
7395,435,"""my business but a life i left"
7396,435,"was such remaining there?"""
7397,435,""
7398,435,"i leaned upon the awe—"
7399,435,"i lingered with before—"
7400,435,"the second like an ocean rolled"
7401,435,and broke against my ear—
7402,435,""

8115,476,"and then to lay them quiet back—"
8116,476,"and go about its care—"
8117,476,"as if the little ebon box"

8119,477,614
8120,477,""
8121,477,"in falling timbers buried—"

8156,479,"veiling the ermine so,"
8157,479,""
8158,479,"smiling, as they request an alms—"
8159,479,"at some imposing door!"

8163,480,""
8164,480,"in winter in my room"
8165,480,"i came upon a worm—"
8166,480,"pink, lank and warm—"
8167,480,"but as he was a worm"
8168,480,"and worms presume"
8169,480,"not quite with him at home—"
8170,480,"secured him by a string"
8171,480,"to something neighboring"
8172,480,"and went along,"
8173,480,""
8174,480,"a trifle afterward"
8175,480,"a thing occurred"

8178,480,"a snake with mottles rare"
8179,480,"surveyed my chamber floor"

8182,480,""
8183,480,"the very string with which"
8184,480,"i tied him—too"
8185,480,"when he was mean and new"

8187,480,""
8188,480,"i shrank—""how fair you are""!"

8193,480,"he fathomed me—"
8194,480,"then to a rhythm slim"
8195,480,"secreted in his form"

8197,480,"projected him,"
8198,480,""

8256,483,"cannot testify—"
8257,483,themself—as dumb—
8258,484,218
8259,484,""
8260,484,"is it true, dear sue?"
8261,484,"are there two?"
8262,484,"i shouldn't like to come"
8263,484,"for fear of joggling him!"
8264,484,"if i could shut him up"
8265,484,"in a coffee cup,"
8266,484,"or tie him to a pin"
8267,484,"till i got in—"
8268,484,"or make him fast"
8269,484,"to ""toby's"" fist—"
8270,484,hist! whist! i'd come!
8271,485,978
8272,485,""
8273,485,"it bloomed and dropt, a single noon—"
8274,485,"the flower—distinct and red—"
8275,485,"i, passing, thought another noon"
8276,485,another in its stead
8277,485,""
8278,485,"will equal glow, and thought no more"
8279,485,"but came another day"
8280,485,"to find the species disappeared—"
8281,485,the same locality—
8282,485,""
8283,485,"the sun in place—no other fraud"
8284,485,"on nature's perfect sum—"
8285,485,"had i but lingered yesterday—"
8286,485,was my retrieveless blame—
8287,485,""
8288,485,"much flowers of this and further zones"

8292,485,""
8293,485,"the single flower of the earth"
8294,485,"that i, in passing by"
8295,485,"unconscious was—great nature's face"
8296,485,passed infinite by me—
8297,486,"it can't be ""summer""!"
8298,486,"that—got through!"
8299,486,"it's early—yet—for ""spring""!"
8300,486,"there's that long town of white—to cross—"
8301,486,"before the blackbirds sing!"
8302,486,"it can't be ""dying""!"
8303,486,"it's too rouge—"
8304,486,"the dead shall go in white—"
8305,486,"so sunset shuts my question down"
8306,486,with cuffs of chrysolite!
8307,487,584
8308,487,""
8309,487,"it ceased to hurt me, though so slow"
8310,487,"i could not feel the anguish go—"
8311,487,"but only knew by looking back—"
8312,487,that something—had benumbed the track—
8313,487,""
8314,487,"nor when it altered, i could say,"
8315,487,"for i had worn it, every day,"
8316,487,"as constant as the childish frock—"
8317,487,"i hung upon the peg, at night,"
8318,487,""
8319,487,"but not the grief—that nestled close"
8320,487,"as needles—ladies softly press"
8321,487,"to cushions cheeks—"
8322,487,to keep their place—
8323,487,""
8324,487,"nor what consoled it, i could trace—"
8325,487,"except, whereas 'twas wilderness—"
8326,487,it's better—almost peace—
8327,488,39
8328,488,""
8329,488,"it did not surprise me—"
8330,488,"so i said—or thought—"
8331,488,"she will stir her pinions"
8332,488,"and the nest forgot,"
8333,488,""
8334,488,"traverse broader forests—"
8335,488,"build in gayer boughs,"
8336,488,"breathe in ear more modern"
8337,488,god's old fashioned vows—
8338,488,""
8339,488,"this was but a birdling—"
8340,488,"what and if it be"
8341,488,"one within my bosom"
8342,488,had departed me?
8343,488,""
8344,488,"this was but a story—"
8345,488,"what and if indeed"
8346,488,"there were just such coffin"
8347,488,in the heart instead?
8348,489,426
8349,489,""
8350,489,"it don't sound so terrible—quite—as it did—"
8351,489,"i run it over—""dead"", brain, ""dead,"""
8352,489,"put it in latin—left of my school—"
8353,489,"seems it don't shriek so—under rule,"
8354,489,""
8355,489,"turn it, a little—full in the face"

8363,489,"like other new things—shows largest—then—"
8364,489,"and smaller, by habit—"
8365,489,""
8366,489,"it's shrewder then"
8367,489,"put the thought in advance—a year—"

8369,489,murder—wear!
8370,490,"it dropped so low -- in my regard --"
8371,490,"i heard it hit the ground --"
8372,490,"and go to pieces on the stones"
8373,490,at bottom of my mind --
8374,490,""
8375,490,"yet blamed the fate that flung it -- less"
8376,490,"than i denounced myself,"
8377,490,"for entertaining plated wares"
8378,490,upon my silver shelf --
8379,491,444
8380,491,""
8381,491,"it feels a shame to be alive—"
8382,491,"when men so brave—are dead—"
8383,491,"one envies the distinguished dust—"
8384,491,permitted—such a head—
8385,491,""
8386,491,"the stone—that tells defending whom"
8387,491,"this spartan put away"
8388,491,"what little of him we—possessed"
8389,491,in pawn for liberty—
8390,491,""
8391,491,"the price is great—sublimely paid—"
8392,491,"do we deserve—a thing—"
8393,491,"that lives—like dollars—must be piled"
8394,491,before we may obtain?
8395,491,""
8396,491,"are we that wait—sufficient worth—"
8397,491,"that such enormous pearl"

8399,491,in battle's—horrid bowl?
8400,491,""
8401,491,"it may be—a renown to live—"
8402,491,"i think the man who die—"
8403,491,"those unsustained—saviors—"
8404,491,present divinity—
8405,492,774
8406,492,""
8407,492,"it is a lonesome glee—"
8408,492,"yet sanctifies the mind—"
8409,492,"with fair association—"
8410,492,afar upon the wind
8411,492,""
8412,492,"a bird to overhear"
8413,492,"delight without a cause—"
8414,492,"arrestless as invisible—"
8415,492,"a matter of the skies,"
8416,493,"it is an honorable thought,"
8417,493,"  and makes one lift one's hat,"
8418,493,"as one encountered gentlefolk"
8419,493,"  upon a daily street,"
8420,493,""
8421,493,"that we've immortal place,"
8422,493,"  though pyramids decay,"
8423,493,"and kingdoms, like the orchard,"
8424,493,"  flit russetly away,"
8425,494,244
8426,494,""
8427,494,"it is easy to work when the soul is at play—"
8428,494,"but when the soul is in pain—"
8429,494,"the hearing him put his playthings up"
8430,494,makes work difficult—then—
8431,494,""
8432,494,"it is simple, to ache in the bone, or the rind—"
8433,494,"but gimlets—among the nerve—"
8434,494,"mangle daintier—terribler—"
8435,494,like a panter in the glove—
8436,495,560
8437,495,""
8438,495,"it knew no lapse, nor diminuation—"
8439,495,"but large—serene—"
8440,495,"burned on—until through dissolution—"
8441,495,it failed from men—
8442,495,""
8443,495,"i could not deem these planetary forces"
8444,495,"annulled—"
8445,495,"but suffered an exchange of territory—"
8446,495,or world—
8447,496,559
8448,496,""
8449,496,"it knew no medicine—"
8450,496,"it was not sickness—then—"
8451,496,"nor any need of surgery—"
8452,496,and therefore—'twas not pain—
8453,496,""
8454,496,"it moved away the cheeks—"
8455,496,"a dimple at a time—"
8456,496,"and left the profile—plainer—"
8457,496,and in the place of bloom
8458,496,""
8459,496,"it left the little tint"
8460,496,"that never had a name—"
8461,496,"you've seen it on a cast's face—"
8462,496,was paradise—to blame—
8463,496,""
8464,496,"if momently ajar—"
8465,496,"temerity—drew near—"
8466,496,"and sickened—ever afterward"
8467,496,for somewhat that it saw?
8468,497,620
8469,497,""
8470,497,"it makes no difference abroad—"
8471,497,"the seasons—fit—the same—"
8472,497,"the mornings blossom into noons—"
8473,497,and split their pods of flame—
8474,497,""
8475,497,"wild flowers—kindle in the woods—"
8476,497,"the brooks slam—all the day—"
8477,497,"no black bird bates his banjo—"
8478,497,for passing calvary—
8479,497,""
8480,497,"auto da fe—and judgment—"
8481,497,"are nothing to the bee—"
8482,497,"his separation from his rose—"
8483,497,to him—sums misery—
8484,498,405
8485,498,""
8486,498,"it might be lonelier"
8487,498,"without the loneliness—"
8488,498,"i'm so accustomed to my fate—"
8489,498,perhaps the other—peace—
8490,498,""
8491,498,"would interrupt the dark—"
8492,498,"and crowd the little room—"
8493,498,"too scant—by cubits—to contain"
8494,498,the sacrament—of him—
8495,498,""
8496,498,"i am not used to hope—"
8497,498,"it might intrude upon—"
8498,498,"its sweet parade—blaspheme the place—"
8499,498,ordained to suffering—
8500,498,""
8501,498,"it might be easier"
8502,498,"to fail—with land in sight—"
8503,498,"than gain—my blue peninsula—"
8504,498,to perish—of delight—
8505,499,"311"
8506,499,"it sifts from leaden sieves—"
8507,499,"it powders all the wood,"
8508,499,"it fills with alabaster wool"
8509,499,the wrinkles of the road—
8510,499,""
8511,499,"it makes an even face"
8512,499,"of mountain, and of plain—"
8513,499,"unbroken forehead from the east"
8514,499,unto the east again—
8515,499,""
8516,499,"it reaches to the fence—"
8517,499,"it wraps it rail by rail"
8518,499,"till it is lost in fleeces—"
8519,499,it deals celestial vail
8520,499,""
8521,499,"to stump, and stack—and stem—"
8522,499,"a summer's empty room—"
8523,499,"acres of joints, where harvests were,"
8524,499,"recordless, but for them--"
8525,499,""
8526,499,"it ruffles wrists of posts"
8527,499,"as ankles of a queen—"
8528,499,"then stills its artisans—like ghosts—"
8529,499,denying they have been—
8530,500,"it struck me—every day—"
8531,500,"the lightning was as new"
8532,500,"as if the cloud that instant slit"
8533,500,and let the fire through—
8534,500,""
8535,500,"it burned me—in the night—"
8536,500,"it blistered to my dream—"
8537,500,"it sickened fresh upon my sight—"
8538,500,with every morn that came—
8539,500,""
8540,500,"i though that storm—was brief—"
8541,500,"the maddest—quickest by—"
8542,500,"but nature lost the date of this—"
8543,500,and left it in the sky—
8544,501,723
8545,501,""
8546,501,"it tossed—and tossed—"
8547,501,"a little brig i knew—o'ertook by blast—"
8548,501,"it spun—and spun—"
8549,501,"and groped delirious, for morn—"
8550,501,""
8551,501,"it slipped—and slipped—"
8552,501,"as one that drunken—stept—"
8553,501,"its white foot tripped—"
8554,501,then dropped from sight—
8555,501,""
8556,501,"ah, brig—good night"
8557,501,"to crew and you—"
8558,501,"the ocean's heart too smooth—too blue—"
8559,501,to break for you—
8560,502,600
8561,502,""
8562,502,"it troubled me as once i was—"
8563,502,"for i was once a child—"
8564,502,"concluding how an atom—fell—"
8565,502,and yet the heavens—held—
8566,502,""
8567,502,"the heavens weighed the most—by far—"
8568,502,"yet blue—and solid—stood—"
8569,502,"without a bolt—that i could prove—"
8570,502,would giants—understand?
8571,502,""
8572,502,"life set me larger—problems—"
8573,502,"some i shall keep—to solve"
8574,502,"till algebra is easier—"
8575,502,or simpler proved—above—
8576,502,""
8577,502,"then—too—be comprehended—"
8578,502,"what sorer—puzzled me—"
8579,502,"why heaven did not break away—"
8580,502,and tumble—blue—on me—
8581,503,876
8582,503,""
8583,503,"it was a grave, yet bore no stone"
8584,503,"enclosed 'twas not of rail"
8585,503,"a consciousness its acre, and"
8586,503,"it held a human soul,"
8587,503,""
8588,503,"entombed by whom, for what offence"
8589,503,"if home or foreign born—"
8590,503,"had i the curiosity"
8591,503,'twere not appeased of men
8592,503,""
8593,503,"till resurrection, i must guess"
8594,503,"denied the small desire"
8595,503,"a rose upon its ridge to sow"
8596,503,"or take away a briar,"
8597,504,454
8598,504,""
8599,504,"it was given to me by the gods—"
8600,504,"when i was a little girl—"
8601,504,"they given us presents most—you know—"
8602,504,"when we are new—and small,"
8603,504,"i kept it in my hand—"
8604,504,"i never put it down—"
8605,504,"i did not dare to eat—or sleep—"
8606,504,"for fear it would be gone—"
8607,504,"i heard such words as ""rich""—"
8608,504,"when hurrying to school—"
8609,504,"from lips at corners of the streets—"
8610,504,"and wrestled with a smile,"
8611,504,"rich! 'twas myself—was rich—"
8612,504,"to take the name of gold—"
8613,504,"and gold to own—in solid bars—"
8614,504,the difference—made me bold—
8615,505,"it was not death, for i stood up,"
8616,505,"and all the dead lie down,"
8617,505,"it was not night, for all the bells"
8618,505,"put out their tongues for noon,"
8619,505,"it was not frost, for on my flesh"
8620,505,"i felt siroccos crawl,"
8621,505,"nor fire, for just my marble feet"
8622,505,"could keep a chancel cool,"
8623,505,"and yet it tasted like them all,"
8624,505,"the figures i have seen"
8625,505,"set orderly for burial"
8626,505,"reminded me of mine,"
8627,505,""
8628,505,"as if my life were shaven"
8629,505,"and fitted to a frame"
8630,505,"and could not breathe without a key,"
8631,505,"and 'twas like midnight, some,"
8632,505,""
8633,505,"when everything that ticked has stopped"
8634,505,"and space stares all around,"
8635,505,"or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,"
8636,505,repeal the beating ground;
8637,505,""
8638,505,"but most like chaos, stopless, cool,"
8639,505,"without a chance, or spar,"
8640,505,"or even a report of land"
8641,505,"to justify despair,"
8642,506,623
8643,506,""
8644,506,"it was too late for man—"
8645,506,"but early, yet, for god—"
8646,506,"creation—impotent to help—"
8647,506,but prayer—remained—our side—
8648,506,""
8649,506,"how excellent the heaven—"
8650,506,"when earth—cannot be had—"

8658,507,and little girls—with dolls—
8659,507,""

8664,507,""
8665,507,"the lilacs—bending many a year—"
8666,507,"will sway with purple load—"
8667,507,"the bees—will not despise the tune—"
8668,507,their forefathers—have hummed—
8669,507,""
8670,507,"the wild rose—redden in the bog—"

8674,507,""
8675,507,"till summer folds her miracle—"

9597,567,"my life had stood—a loaded gun—"
9598,567,"in corners—till a day"
9599,567,"the owner passed—identified—"
9600,567,and carried me away—
9601,567,""
9602,567,"and now we roam in sovereign woods—"
9603,567,"and now we hunt the doe—"

9607,567,"and do i smile, such cordial light"

9635,569,564
9636,569,""

9642,569,"god grows above—so those who pray"
9643,569,"horizons—must ascend—"
9644,569,"and so i stepped upon the north"
9645,569,to see this curious friend—
9646,569,""
9647,569,"his house was not—no sign had he—"
9648,569,"by chimney—nor by door"
9649,569,"could i infer his residence—"
9650,569,vast prairies of air

9655,569,that i might look on thee?
9656,569,""
9657,569,"the silence condescended—"
9658,569,"creation stopped—for me—"
9659,569,"but awed beyond my errand—"

9661,570,639
9662,570,""
9663,570,"my portion is defeat—today—"

9671,570,"and men too straight to stoop again—,"
9672,570,"and piles of solid moan—"
9673,570,"and chips of blank—in boyish eyes—"
9674,570,"and scraps of prayer—"
9675,570,"and death's surprise,"
9676,570,stamped visible—in stone—
9677,570,""
9678,570,"there's somewhat prouder, over there—"
9679,570,"the trumpets tell it to the air—"
9680,570,"how different victory"
9681,570,"to him who has it—and the one"

9684,571,343
9685,571,""
9686,571,"my reward for being, was this,"

9689,571,"a sceptre—penniless—"

9977,589,""
9978,589,"no notice gave she, but a change—"
9979,589,"no message, but a sigh—"

9981,589,"that she should specify,"
9982,589,""
9983,589,"she was not warm, though summer shone"

9988,589,"of shrinking ways—she did not fright"
9989,589,"though all the village looked—"
9990,589,"but held her gravity aloft—"
9991,589,and met the gaze—direct—
9992,589,""
9993,589,"and when adjusted like a seed"
9994,589,"in careful fitted ground"
9995,589,"unto the everlasting spring"

10004,590,"no other can reduce"
10005,590,"our mortal consequence"

10209,605,of beggar—or of bird—
10210,605,""
10211,605,"of small and spicy yards—"
10212,605,"in hue—a mellow dun—"

10220,606,894

10231,607,376
10232,607,""
10233,607,"of course—i prayed—"

10236,607,"a bird—had stamped her foot—"
10237,607,"and cried ""give me""—"

10256,608,"in just the jacket that he wore—"
10257,608,"long buttoned in the mold"
10258,608,"since we—old mornings, children—played—"

10289,610,"that bells should ring till all should know"

10303,611,"no ornament, but palms—"
10304,611,""

10310,611,"our panting ankle barely passed—"
10311,611,"when night devoured the road—"
10312,611,"but we—stood whispering in the house—"

10331,613,""
10332,613,"on such a night, or such a night,"

10350,613,or early task to do?

11266,671,"i cannot tell the sum,"

11270,671,"no more her patient figure"

11273,671,upon the village street—
11274,671,""
11275,671,"but crowns instead, and courtiers—"
11276,671,"and in the midst so fair,"

11279,672,479
11280,672,""
11281,672,"she dealt her pretty words like blades—"
11282,672,"how glittering they shone—"
11283,672,"and every one unbared a nerve"
11284,672,or wantoned with a bone—
11285,672,""
11286,672,"she never deemed—she hurt—"
11287,672,"that—is not steel's affair—"
11288,672,"a vulgar grimace in the flesh—"

11294,672,"just locking up—to die,"
11295,673,75
11296,673,""
11297,673,"she died at play,"
11298,673,"gambolled away"
11299,673,"her lease of spotted hours,"
11300,673,"then sank as gaily as a turn"
11301,673,"upon a couch of flowers,"
11302,673,""
11303,673,"her ghost strolled softly o'er the hill"

11306,673,"her countenance as spray,"
11307,674,150
11308,674,""
11309,674,"she died—this was the way she died,"
11310,674,"and when her breath was done"
11311,674,"took up her simple wardrobe"
11312,674,"and started for the sun,"
11313,674,"her little figure at the gate"
11314,674,"the angels must have spied,"
11315,674,"since i could never find her"
11316,674,"upon the mortal side,"

11320,675,"where daffodils—abide—"
11321,675,"her maker—her metropolis—"
11322,675,the universe—her maid—
11323,675,""
11324,675,"to fetch her grace—and hue—"
11325,675,"and fairness—and renown—"

11327,675,and fetch her thee—be mine—
11328,676,557
11329,676,""
11330,676,"she hideth her the last—"
11331,676,"and is the first, to rise—"
11332,676,"her night doth hardly recompense"
11333,676,the closing of her eyes—
11334,676,""
11335,676,"she doth her purple work—"
11336,676,"and putteth her away"
11337,676,"in low apartments in the sod -"
11338,676,"as worthily as we,"
11339,676,""
11340,676,"to imitate her life"
11341,676,"as impotent would be"
11342,676,"as make of our imperfect mints,"
11343,676,the julep—of the bee—
11344,677,369
11345,677,""
11346,677,"she lay as if at play"
11347,677,"her life had leaped away—"
11348,677,"intending to return—"
11349,677,but not so soon—
11350,677,""
11351,677,"her merry arms, half dropt—"
11352,677,"as if for lull of sport—"
11353,677,"an instant had forgot—"
11354,677,the trick to start—
11355,677,""
11356,677,"her dancing eyes—ajar—"
11357,677,"as if their owner were"
11358,677,"still sparkling through"
11359,677,for fun—at you—
11360,677,""
11361,677,"her morning at the door—"
11362,677,"devising, i am sure—"
11363,677,"to force her sleep—"
11364,677,so light—so deep—
11365,678,507
11366,678,""
11367,678,"she sights a bird—she chuckles—"
11368,678,"she flattens—then she crawls—"
11369,678,"she runs without the look of feet—"
11370,678,her eyes increase to balls—
11371,678,""
11372,678,"her jaws stir—twitching—hungry—"
11373,678,"her teeth can hardly stand—"
11374,678,"she leaps, but robin leaped the first—"
11375,678,"ah, pussy, of the sand,"
11376,678,""
11377,678,"the hopes so juicy ripening—"
11378,678,"you almost bather your tongue—"
11379,678,"when bliss disclosed a hundred toes—"
11380,678,and fled with every one—
11381,679,25
11382,679,""
11383,679,"she slept beneath a tree—"
11384,679,"remembered but by me,"
11385,679,"i touched her cradle mute—"
11386,679,"she recognized the foot—"
11387,679,"put on her carmine suit"
11388,679,    and see!
11389,680,991
11390,680,""
11391,680,"she sped as petals of a rose"
11392,680,"offended by the wind—"
11393,680,"a frail aristocrat of time"
11394,680,"indemnity to find—"
11395,680,"leaving on nature—a default"
11396,680,"as cricket or as bee—"
11397,680,"but andes in the bosoms where"
11398,680,she had begun to lie—
11399,681,798
11400,681,""
11401,681,"she staked her feathers—gained an arc—"
11402,681,"debated—rose again—"
11403,681,"this time—beyond the estimate"
11404,681,"of envy, or of men—"
11405,681,""
11406,681,"and now, among circumference—"
11407,681,"her steady boat be seen—"
11408,681,"at home—among the billows—as"
11409,681,the bough where she was born—
11410,682,"she sweeps with many-colored brooms,"
11411,682,"and leaves the shreds behind;"
11412,682,"oh, housewife in the evening west,"
11413,682,"come back, and dust the pond!"
11414,682,""
11415,682,"you dropped a purple ravelling in,"
11416,682,"you dropped an amber thread;"
11417,682,"and now you've littered all the east"
11418,682,with duds of emerald!
11419,682,""
11420,682,"and still she plies her spotted brooms,"
11421,682,"and still the aprons fly,"
11422,682,"till brooms fade softly into stars --"
11423,682,"and then i come away,"
11424,683,149
11425,683,""
11426,683,"she went as quiet as the dew"
11427,683,"from an accustomed flower,"
11428,683,"not like the dew, did she return"
11429,683,at the accustomed hour!
11430,683,""
11431,683,"she dropt as softly as a star"
11432,683,"from out my summer's eve—"
11433,683,"less skillful than le verriere"

11436,684,""
11437,684,"she's happy, with a new content—"
11438,684,"that feels to her—like sacrament—"
11439,684,"she's busy—with an altered care—"
11440,684,as just apprenticed to the air—
11441,684,""
11442,684,"she's tearful—if she weep at all—"
11443,684,"for blissful causes—most of all"

15284,926,"existence—in itself—"
15285,926,"without a further function—"
15286,926,omnipotence—enough—

15297,927,"a darker ribbon—for a day—"
15298,927,"a crape upon the hat—"

15302,927,"the absent—mystic—creature—"
15303,927,"that but for love of us—"
15304,927,"had gone to sleep—that soundest time—"
15305,927,without the weariness—
15306,928,126

15522,943,"to put this world down, like a bundle—"

15542,944,"to this world she returned,"

15545,944,"as a sod"
15546,944,"espoused a violet,"
15547,944,"that chiefer to the skies"
15548,944,"than to himself, allied,"

15551,945,57

15553,945,"to venerate the simple days"
15554,945,"which lead the seasons by,"

16016,976,"when light is put away --"

16019,976,""
16020,976,"a moment -- we uncertain step"
